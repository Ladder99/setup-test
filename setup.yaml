# the Ladder99 Adapter service reads this section to know what devices to poll/subscribe to.
# each device driver polls or subscribes to data from a device, then sends the
# data to the Agent via SHDR (a simple key-value text format).
# the Agent then fits that data into an XML structure as defined by the corresponding
# agent.xml and agent.cfg files.

  # providers - define shared input connections -
  # eg an mqttProvider that dispatches to mqttSubscribers.

    sharedMqtt: # arbitrary name, use as device/source/connection string value

    # # the host device polls the host os/cpu for load, temperature, disk for free space, etc.
    # - id: host # must match id in agent.xml
    #   name: Host # this must match name in agent.cfg and agent.xml
    #   # see also device alias in the relay section.

    #   # each device has one or more "sources", which use drivers that feed data to
    #   # a key-value cache - when a key's value changes, the cache sends the new value
    #   # to the Agent via SHDR.
    #   sources:
    #     # the host device driver defines a set of cache outputs in an outputs.yaml file.
    #     # these map from the cache keys to the SHDR keys.
    #     # it also defines a set of cache inputs in an inputs.yaml file.
    #     # the driver itself is a node.js module that polls the host os data.
